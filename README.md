# React Inline Edit Async

React component for inline edit of text/select values, expecting an async (promise) onChange method.

I wrote this package to replace the good [`riek`](https://github.com/kaivi/riek) package that served me well, but hasn't been updated in 3 years.

## Documentation
Will be available very soon: the first 0.1.0 version of this package has just been published (April 7th 2020).
